# Project Title

MAM_BLE_Python

## Description

Scripts for setting the device ID and reading the number of bounces of the "Make A Million" (MAM) bouncing ball.  This is a BLE connected ball that will report how many times it bounces.   Unfortunately the app is still available but the backend services are not, rendering the ball from a smart toy to a regular ball.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python 3.9
* Python Bleak library for BLE connectivity

## Acknowledgments

Lots of inspiration and key info about UUIDs/etc from the millionbounce project
